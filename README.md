# Work-in-Python
1. This repository contains all my Python prototypes used for quantitative finance and business analysis.
2. All the Python scripts with extension '.ipynb' are done during the learning of module 'Programming for Business Application' (module code: IB2D40) in the University of Warwick. The script names start with 'Business programming seminar' and are quoted with topics under brackets, those are done as practice with specific topics. All the Python script with the extension name '.ipynb' are powered by Google Colab.
3. The Python scripts with extension '.py' are done during the internship and my personal research project.
4. No branch is made explicitly because there are lots of similarities between Quant finance and Business analysis.
